 1.Obtain a sample phishing email 
Subject: Your Account Will Be Deactivated – Immediate Action Required
 From: support@secure-mail.com
To: srilakshmivt@gmail.com 
Date: August 5, 2025

 2 .Examine sender's email address for spoofing


Suspicious Sender Address:


Email:  support@secure-mail.com 


Issue: The domain secure-mail.com is generic and not associated with any known organization.


3.Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.


Phrases: "Immediate Action Required", "Failure to do so within 24 hours will result in account suspension."


Issue: Creates a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action without scrutiny.






4.Identify suspicious links or attachments.


Suspicious Link:


 Displayed Text:  [Verify Now]


 Actual URL:  http://secure-update-info.com/verify 


Issue: The link leads to an unrecognized domain, which could be a phishing site.


5. Generic Greeting:


Text: "Dear User"


Issue: Lacks personalization, which is common in phishing 


6.Grammar and Spelling Errors:


Example: "Failure to do so within 24 hours will result in account suspension."


Issue: While grammatically correct, the tone is unprofessional and threatening.


7.Check email headers for discrepancies 


Domain:  secure-update-info.com 


Issue: Not associated with any legitimate organization.
