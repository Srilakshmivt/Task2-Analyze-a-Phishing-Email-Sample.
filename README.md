# Task2-Analyze-a-Phishing-Email-Sample.
This repository includes a phishing email sample and a detailed analysis report focused on identifying phishing indicators using multiple tools—including EML Analyzer ,VirusTotal.

MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer: Converts raw headers into readable format and highlights SPF/DKIM results.
VirusTotal Documentation: Detailed overview of how VirusTotal API can be used for URL/file scanning.

Why Include VirusTotal?

VirusTotal is a widely used service for scanning URLs and attachments using multiple antivirus engines and sandbox environments.

When provided with a link or file, VirusTotal returns a threat rating and detection summary, enabling you to determine if a phishing URL is associated with known malicious campaigns.

Automating this step (e.g., via API or integration tools like n8n) ensures consistent and reliable tracking of phishing threats.
