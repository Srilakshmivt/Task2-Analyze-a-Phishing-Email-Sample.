Why Include VirusTotal?

VirusTotal is a widely used service for scanning URLs and attachments using multiple antivirus engines and sandbox environments.

When provided with a link or file, VirusTotal returns a threat rating and detection summary, enabling you to determine if a phishing URL is associated with known malicious campaigns.

Automating this step (e.g., via API or integration tools like n8n) ensures consistent and reliable tracking of phishing threats.
